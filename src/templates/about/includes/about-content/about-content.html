    <h6>
      I am a freelance copywriter, editor, and communications consultant. Now based in Vietnam, I relocated from London in 2016 after almost
      a decade in media relations and public affairs roles.

    <p>
      Since moving to Asia I have delivered projects for clients in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, France, the United States, Thailand,
      Vietnam, and the UK. I have worked with chambers of commerce, digital marketing agencies, international universities, government
      embassies, market research consultancies, law firms, financial publishers, stock brokerages, start-ups, charities and non-profits.

      Before leaving the UK, I held a senior communications position at a national medical regulator, managing high-profile press
      investigations and nationwide media campaigns. I briefed journalists on breaking news stories, prepared the Chief Executive for
      interviews, drafted press releases and media statements, and acted as a spokesperson.

      I also worked in the public affairs team of the UK’s most influential health think-tank, as a press officer for one of Britain’s
      largest political parties, and as an aide to two Members of Parliament.
